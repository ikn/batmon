POSIX C library

    INSTALLATION

With GNU make or equivalent, run

    make
    make install

The makefile respects the prefix, DESTDIR, etc. arguments.  Of course,
`make install' needs to be run as root if installing outside of your home
directory.  To uninstall, run

    make uninstall

`make clean' and `make distclean' are also supported, and work as expected.

    USAGE

pwrnotify is installed to /usr/local/bin/ by default, and can be run from there
or you can just copy the executable elsewhere and run it without installing.
It takes any number of integer arguments as percentage battery levels to
display a warning at.
